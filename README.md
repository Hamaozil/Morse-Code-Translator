# Morse-Code-Translator
### I have done an Arduino hardware project that is able to translate morse code, Interesting isn't it !?

# so what is more code !? 
### To those who don't know about it let me quickly explain it.
### Morse is about sending data in the form of dots `.` and dashes `-`, and I have connected it with Python to be able to say whatever user type.

## To be able to use my code you have to install these libraries 
1. for getting data from Arduino serial :
   `pip install pyserial`
2. for saying letters or words :
   `pip install pyttsx3`
